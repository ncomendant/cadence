# Cadence
A virtual-reality game designed in Unity.

Blocks and orbs fly at you. Collect them, and you damage your enemy. Fail to do so, and you take damage yourself. The game ends once one of your health bars reach zero. Menu screen and multiple difficulty levels included.

Supports both the HTC Vive (the only VR headset I have) and non-VR, though the game is far more difficult in non-VR.

# How to Run

Current build is for Windows only.

Download and extract "build/cadence_win_x86_64.zip" into a directory of your choice and run "cadence.exe" in the extracted folder. If an HTC is setup, it will automatically use VR mode. Otherwise it will default to non-VR.
